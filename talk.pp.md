## Patents

### The idea

> ... the (US) Constitution, which, in the name of
> "the progress of science and the useful arts,"
> gives Congress the power to grant inventors
> "the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries" for a limited time
> -- generally 20 years
> -- during which period competitors are forbidden from selling similar products
> Without those assurances, there would arguably be no incentive to innovate

Originally, this applied mostly to mechanical machines; think:

* steam engine
* internal combustion engine

### The problem(s) with patents

* Too many things can be patented
* Patent rights are steadily extended to favour the patent holders
* are used as legal, political and social weapons
* are only available to an elite (costly)
* patent officers are too few, have to little time, and no expertise in what they are supposed to examine, and thus grant patents that shoudl not be granted
* algorithms can be patented
* patent trolls (a company that doesnâ€™t make products but exists solely on the revenue of its patents) -- a multibillion-dollar industry,

modern patents:

* a (naturally occuring gene) in pigs that makes them grow bigger and faster
* a single-click order button
* online advertisement
* image-capturing device with wireless transmitter -- (2018), Rothchild vs Gnome
* Methods and Systems for User Opt-In to Data Privacy Agreements -- US legal practise
* trading informed by  social media posts


## CopyLeft

Here we are fine! :-)

* Originated from the _Free Software_ movement
* Divided into _Free Software_ and _Open Source_
* separate Licenses for Software and othre works
